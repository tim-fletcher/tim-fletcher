Readme file for rainfall (monbulk_rain_now_NEW.csv) & flow (monbulk_flow_cumecs_NEW.csv) data files

Both these files are recorded data from the Melbourne Water station 228229B (Monbulk Ck at Monbulk Ck RB, Lysterfield).
They each cover the period from 01/01/2009 00:00 to 31/12/2016 00:00 and are at 6-minute timesteps.

monbulk_rain_now_NEW.csv is a single vector with the rainfall (mm) in each 6 minute timestep (no date-time column is given).  This is the TOTAL rainfall
in the 6 minute timestep.  For example, if it is 1.2, there was 1.2 mm of rain during that period.

monbulk_flow_cumecs_NEW.csv is the same structure, but with a 'dummy' column with 'bla' written in it; this can be ignored/removed.  The flow is in cumecs
(cubic metres (or kilolitres) per second).  Because this is per second, this is the AVERAGE flow rate during that period.  For example, if the reading for
a given 6-minute timestep is 1.5 (m3/sec), then the TOTAL flow during that period = 0.5 x 60 x 60 = 18000 m3.
