Readme file for rainfall (monbulk_rain_now_NEW.csv) & flow (monbulk_flow_cumecs_NEW.csv) data files

Both these files are recorded data from the Melbourne Water station 228229B (Monbulk Ck at Monbulk Ck RB, Lysterfield).
They each cover the period from 01/01/2009 00:00 to 31/12/2016 00:00 and are at 6-minute timesteps.

monbulk_rain_now_NEW.csv is a single vector with the rainfall (mm) in each 6 minute timestep (no date-time column is given)
monbulk_flow_cumecs_NEW.csv is the same structure, but with a 'dummy' column with 'bla' written in it; this can be ignored/removed
